# Commit Message Rules

- Commit messages must be **short but descriptive** (max 50 characters in the subject line).
- Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line (e.g., "Add user validation").
- Do not use a period at the end of the subject line.
- If needed, add a more detailed description in a second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
- Follow the convention: `<type>: <message>`, where `<type>` can be:
  - feat: for new features
  - fix: for bug fixes
  - docs: for documentation changes
  - style: for formatting changes (no code logic)
  - refactor: for code refactoring
  - test: for adding or fixing tests
  - chore: for maintenance tasks
- Example of a valid message:
  ```
  feat: add user registration endpoint

  Allows registering new users with email validation.
  ```

- Avoid generic messages like "update", "changes", "various fixes".
